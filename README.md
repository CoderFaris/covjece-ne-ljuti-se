# Don't Get Mad (Ludo-style Board Game)

## Description
Golang implementation of a Ludo-style board game with custom modifications. It features a board where players roll dice, move their pieces, and interact with special tiles and other players' pieces.

## Features
- 4-player gameplay
- Player movement on a custom board layout
- Special "booster" tiles
- Lap counting

## Rules
Don't Get Mad is a 4-player board game where players try to lap the entire board 4 times. The twist here is that instead of having 4 pieces like in a regular Ludo game, here you have only 1 piece that needs to reach a lap count of 4. There are also some other modifications like special board tiles (booster tiles). The rest of the functionality is pretty much the same.
